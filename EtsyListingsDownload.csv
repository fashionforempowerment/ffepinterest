"BROWN CASHMERE / WOOL Throw | Blanket | Baby Blanket | Summer Blanket | Farmhouse | Wabi Sabi | Nautical | Aesthetic | Organic | Reversible","Handcrafted in Germany by a Family of Women Artisans

The quality and artistry of our pieces lend an elegant, timeless feel to each one, instantly creating an heirloom piece that will be treasured by generations to come. From our timeless, handmade pieces to life-changing opportunities we create, we’re cultivating a movement that is made to last.

-----
STORY - This luxurious blend of cashmere and lambswool can serve as a throw or blanket, keeping you or your loved one cozy in the winter, perfect for chilly nights. Handcrafted via a laborious and time-intensive process, from warping the looms to twisting the fringes or tassels at the very end, these pieces require expertise, a trained eye, and unparalleled craftsmanship. One throw can grace 20 different women’s hands throughout the creation process. Not only are these pieces insulating yet breathable, but oh-so-soft and luscious, and not even remotely scratchy. We are using natural fibers of the finest and most precious quality -- from the first shearings of Mongolian Cashmere Goats to Australian Merino Wool Sheep.

The pieces we design and sell seamlessly fuse the quality and craftsmanship of traditional hand-crafting techniques with modern styles and functionality. From our meticulously monitored work environments for artisans to environmentally-responsible processes and materials, we’re working to give your family the gift of carefully and responsibly made heirlooms.

-----
IMPACT - By working directly with our women-led cooperatives and like-minded grassroots organizations, we cut out the cost of working through a middleman. Our prices reflect the quality and craftsmanship required to create luxury products, while directly benefiting the communities creating them.

Women are monumentally impacted by systemic poverty. Consider (just a few of) the facts: only ⅓ can read or write, over one million per year are captured by human trafficking, and in low- and middle-income countries, giving birth after a forced child marriage is a leading cause of death. That’s why every purchase empowers women to overcome socio-economic barriers and live safer, healthier lives by developing their skills through vocational training and helping to develop the resources for a sustainable future.

Handcrafted via a laborious and time-intensive process, from warping the looms to twisting the fringes or tassels at the very end, these pieces require expertise, a trained eye, and unparalleled craftsmanship. One throw can grace 20 different women’s hands throughout the creation process. Not only are these pieces insulating yet breathable, but oh-so-soft and luscious, and not even remotely scratchy. We are using natural fibers of the finest and most precious quality -- from the first shearings of Mongolian Cashmere Goats to Australian Merino Wool Sheep.

The pieces we design and sell seamlessly fuse the quality and craftsmanship of traditional hand-crafting techniques with modern styles and functionality. From our meticulously monitored work environments for artisans to environmentally-responsible processes and materials, we’re working to give your family the gift of carefully and responsibly made heirlooms.

------
IMPACT - By working directly with our women-led cooperatives and like-minded grassroots organizations, we cut out the cost of working through a middleman. Our prices reflect the quality and craftsmanship required to create luxury products, while directly benefiting the communities creating them.

Women are monumentally impacted by systemic poverty. Consider (just a few of) the facts: only ⅓ can read or write, over one million per year are captured by human trafficking, and in low- and middle-income countries, giving birth after a forced child marriage is a leading cause of death. That’s why every purchase empowers women to overcome socio-economic barriers and live safer, healthier lives by developing their skills through vocational training and helping to develop the resources for a sustainable future.

"BROWN ALPACA POM Throw | Blanket | Baby Blanket | Summer Blanket | Farmhouse | Wabi Sabi | Nautical | Aesthetic | Organic | Natural","Handcrafted in Peru

The quality and artistry of our pieces lend an elegant, timeless feel to each one, instantly creating an heirloom piece that will be treasured by generations to come. From our timeless, handmade pieces to life-changing opportunities we create, we’re cultivating a movement that is made to last. 

------
STORY - This luxurious blend of pima cotton and fine alpaca can serve as a throw or blanket, keeping you or your loved one cozy in the winter, perfect for chilly nights. Handcrafted via a laborious and time-intensive process, from warping the looms to twisting the fringes or tassels at the very end, these pieces require expertise, a trained eye, and unparalleled craftsmanship. Not only are these pieces insulating yet breathable, but oh-so-soft and luscious, and not even remotely scratchy. Hypoallergenic and moisture-wicking, an alpaca throw is the comfort piece for your home. We are using natural fibers of the finest and most precious quality -- from the first shearings of the Huacaya and Suri Alpacas.  Learn More about the Handmade Process.

The pieces we design and sell seamlessly fuse the quality and craftsmanship of traditional hand-crafting techniques with modern styles and functionality. From our meticulously monitored work environments for artisans to environmentally-responsible processes and materials, we’re working to give your family the gift of carefully and responsibly made heirlooms.

IMPACT - By working directly with our women-led cooperatives and like-minded grassroots organizations, we cut out the cost of working through a middleman. Our prices reflect the quality and craftsmanship required to create luxury products, while directly benefiting the communities creating them.

STORY - This luxurious blend of pima cotton and fine alpaca can serve as a throw or blanket, keeping you or your loved one cozy in the winter, perfect for chilly nights.

Hypoallergenic and moisture-wicking, an alpaca throw is the comfort piece for your home. We are using natural fibers of the finest and most precious quality -- from the first shearings of the Huacaya and Suri Alpacas.  Learn More about the Handmade Process.

STORY - This luxurious blend of organic bamboo and cotton can serve as a throw, scarf, or towel -- up to you! Not only is it highly absorbent, but also thermal-regulating. It will regulate your body temperature, keeping you or your loved one cozy in the winter, and shielding you from the sun in the summer. As it is light-weight and folds up compactly, it’s perfect for traveling with you on your next adventure.  

The pieces we design and sell seamlessly fuse the quality and craftsmanship of traditional hand-crafting techniques with modern styles and functionality. From our meticulously monitored work environments for artisans to environmentally-responsible processes and materials, we’re working to give your family the gift of carefully and responsibly made heirlooms.

IMPACT - By working directly with our women-led cooperatives and like-minded grassroots organizations, we cut out the cost of working through a middleman. Our prices reflect the quality and craftsmanship required to create luxury products, while directly benefiting the communities creating them.

Women are monumentally impacted by systemic poverty. Consider (just a few of) the facts: only ⅓ can read or write, over one million per year are captured by human trafficking, and in low- and middle-income countries, giving birth after a forced child marriage is a leading cause of death. That’s why every purchase empowers women to overcome socio-economic barriers and live safer, healthier lives by developing their skills through vocational training and helping to develop the resources for a sustainable future.

Using natural fibers of the finest and most precious quality, these throws will dress your surroundings with classic simplicity while offering you a unique blend of comfort, practicality, and elegance. 

The pieces we design and sell seamlessly fuse the quality and craftsmanship of traditional hand-crafting techniques with modern styles and functionality. From our meticulously monitored work environments for artisans to environmentally-responsible processes and materials, we’re working to give your family the gift of carefully and responsibly made heirlooms.

Women are monumentally impacted by systemic poverty.
